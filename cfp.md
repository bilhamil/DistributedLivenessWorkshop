title: Call for Participation
---

Our CHI 2022 workshop "Tearing Down The Silent Dark Wall: Designing For Distributed Liveness" addresses the growing need for new ways to experience live events. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered how we attend conferences, classes, and more. What once were experiences built around physical co-presence now have participants distributed around the world. Ad-hoc use of commercial platforms, such as Zoom, have enabled hosting live events but further work is needed to improve social co-presence and participation.

This workshopâ€™s objective is to understand and evaluate practitioner's methods for distributed live experiences, and in the process, establish next steps. We invite researchers, designers, educators, artists, and performers to submit artifacts that either 1.) describe novel approaches to supporting distributed live events or 2.) suggest inspired visions that promote social co-presence among distributed participants. This will be a one day, in-person workshop, with a virtual session one week before.

To apply, submit an artifact in the form of a position paper (2000 word limit), pictorial, design fiction, or video demonstration by email to [chi2022@distributedliveness.com](mailto:chi2022@distributedliveness.com). The submission deadline is February 24, 2022. Submissions will be reviewed by organizers based on fit, value, and diversity of perspective. Accepted submissions will be published on the website. Upon acceptance, at least one author from each submission must register to attend the workshop, and all participants must register for both the workshop and at least one day of the conference.
